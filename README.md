# Problem Statement
## Objective: 
Use K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on annual_income (USD), spending_score (0-100 scale), savings (USD), and age (years). The model will help a retail company tailor marketing strategies for different customer segments (e.g., high-income spenders, conservative savers).

## Business Context: 
Understanding customer segments enables personalized marketing, product recommendations, and loyalty programs. The project includes automated data preprocessing, experiment tracking with MLflow, and a Streamlit app for visualizing customer segments and predicting segment membership for new customers.

## Success Criteria: 
Identify meaningful clusters (e.g., 3-5 clusters based on the elbow method), achieve low inertia (indicating tight clusters), track experiments with MLflow, and deploy a user-friendly Streamlit interface for segment prediction and visualization.
